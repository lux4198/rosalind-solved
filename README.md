## About 

These are some of my solved bioinformatic problems from rosalind.info. They were a great way to learn more about bioinformatics and I highly reccomend the site. 
I used python to solve the problems, but you can use any programming language you like. 

## What I've learned 

- general approaches to problem solving and debugging small applications 
- working with RegEX in python for pattern matching 
- using generators / list comprehensions appropriately 
- standard list / string operations in python
